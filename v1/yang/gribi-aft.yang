    "This module defines the gRIBI API. It is used to generate
    the protobuf definition of the schema that is used in the
    protocol.

    TODO(robjs): This module needs to self-augment to add the
    relevant config containers to the AFT schema. At the moment
    this is achieved through path compression, which means directly
    using the YANG schema is not actually possible.";
